# Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (for the extension menu)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (for the extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (for the Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create simple icons using any image editor:
1. Create square images with the dimensions above
2. Save them as PNG files
3. Place them in this directory

The extension will work without these icons (Chrome will use a default icon), but having custom icons makes the extension look more professional.

## Quick Icon Creation

You can use online tools like:
- [Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/)
- [Icon Generator](https://www.icongenerator.net/)
- Or any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
